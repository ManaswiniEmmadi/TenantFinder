Tenant Finder is an initiative to build up a strong connection between a tenant and a landlord. Our aim is to provide a common interface using which both a tenant and a landlord can fulfill their needs regarding accommodation. This is an application that serves as a platform for finding a tenant. If anyone is looking for a property, this app will show all the available properties and the necessary details. This app will allow users to rent their property and find any other listed property. The application will allow the user to login to the app using username and password.
